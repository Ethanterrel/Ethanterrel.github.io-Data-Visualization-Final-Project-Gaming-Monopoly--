## Gaming Monopoly _**(Intro to visualization final project)**_ ##
_**By:Ethan Lewis**_


## Description ##
The Visualization demonstrates how major publishing companies (Microsoft, Sony, THQ) are buying up developers. The triangles represent acquired companies that are 
made up of 5 or more studios, while the circles represent standalone studios that were acquired. When the Visualization is run two things should be very evident, that verify the Vizualiation is working accordingly, Sony should have the most circles since they’ve mostly acquired standalone studios and Microsoft should have the most triangles 
Due since they acquire more companies. As for the other categories, Indies should hold 0 triangles, THQ should have a decent number of both, and other should have more triangles than circles.
## Installation Directions ##
You can either run the visualization through this site: https://ethanterrel.github.io/Ethanterrel.github.io-Data-Visualization-Final-Project-Gaming-Monopoly-/ 

OR clone the repo and then you should be able to run the code in your IDE of choice.
## Lessons Learned ##
This project extended my knowledge in understanding on how to further implement d3 in an interactive environment such as this. After doing a lot of research with similar income related funnel charts, it became clear that the complexity of creating something like this would be involved but would be a great challenge nonetheless. We learned a great deal with how to make a complex JSON file to read and connect with our js file and the data within it and this was one of the main hurdles we needed to understand to display the project in our HTML file.
